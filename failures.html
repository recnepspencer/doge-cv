                <strong>Underestimating Project Scope:</strong>
                I took on the challenge of developing an enterprise-level farm application on my own, overestimating my capacity to complete such a massive project solo. After 25,000 lines of code, I was only 20% through. This failure taught me the importance of scaling my goals, accepting collaboration, and recognizing that ideals mean nothing if you can’t sell or develop them. I’ve learned to value tangible, achievable outcomes over lofty visions that can’t yet be realized.

                <strong>Not Being Nice Enough to my Wife</strong>
                In my marriage, I focused too much on what I thought was lacking, missing the value of focusing on strengths. It was a hard lesson, but I’ve learned that calling attention to positive traits produces more improvement than criticism, no matter how valid. This insight has given me a marriage that’s stronger and happier than ever, reinforcing the power of encouragement in any relationship.

                <strong>Overcommitting and Losing Focus:</strong>
                I threw myself into countless projects, often neglecting time with family and friends in the process. I didn’t learn to take on less, because I love having a full plate. Instead, I learned that when I neglect the people who matter most, I lose the very grounding that fuels my drive. By prioritizing family and friends, I discovered that I stay motivated and focused, and, in the end, the projects actually get done.
