                <strong>Academic Transformation & Skills Development:</strong><br>
                - Matured from a 3.0 GPA freshman to a 4.0 GPA senior, completing a software engineering degree (Graduating December).<br>
                - Rounded out education with electives in political science, economics, and marketing.<br>
                - Taught myself coding in six months and secured a tech role during a challenging industry period.

                <strong>Real Estate and Cost-Cutting:</strong>
                I acquired a profitable duplex while still in college and cut renovation costs from a projected $35,000 to $15,000 through innovative, frugal approaches.

                <strong>Locating a Missing Person:</strong>
                Despite physical distance, I led efforts to retrieve a missing person by calling local businesses and getting security footage to assist in the search direction.

                <strong>Doubling Solar Profit:</strong>
                I implemented a unique marketing strategy for a door-to-door solar campaign, resulting in a 400% increase in appointments and a 200% increase in profits. This was achieved by breaking a bottleneck that allowed access into a previously unsellable niche market.
