                <strong>Overthrow Local Government:</strong>
                I aspire to work with friends to get us elected to a local city council, allowing us to cut burdensome zoning laws that inflate costs and discourage development, therefore making housing in the area more affordable.
            </p>

                <strong>Revolutionize Fast Food:</strong>
                I want to crush the fast-food industry with a cafeteria-style model that offers fewer but higher-quality, affordable meals. Picture moms grabbing breakfast with their kids on the way to school or dads swinging by for a budget-friendly dinner. Fast food can watch its market shrink, one healthy meal at a time.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Build a Family Legacy:</strong>
                I dream of raising a large family—10 children—and never failing them. That way I can raise an army of entrepreneurs and smart people to lead the next generation.
